# Task:
#     You are given three integers: `a`, `b`, and `m`. Print two lines.
#     On the first line, print the result of pow(a,b). On the second line, print the result of pow(a,b,m).
#
# Input Format:
#     The first line contains `a`, the second line contains `b`, and the third line contains `m`.

a, b, m = int(input()), int(input()), int(input())

print(pow(a, b), pow(a, b, m), sep="\n")
